# Introduction
This is the learning outcome of 6 weeks' summer workshop at Parsons in preparation for Data Visualization MS porgram in Fall 2021.


## Summer Workshop Details

In this intensive workshop, I learned to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as JavaScript frameworks.

### Assignment 1: HTML & CSS

I created an **About Me** page using HTML and CSS. To create a dynamic and responsive page, I incorporated CSS `grid` and `media query` functions.

### Assignment 2: JavaScript Functions

I created an HTML page that displayed various JavaScript functions. For each function, I created a test and if the function is written correctly, the result should display **true**.

### Assignment 3: JavaScript Functions

I created an HTML page that displays some Studio Ghibli data fetched by JavaScript. I also created pagination buttons to show data in 5 increments. 

### Assignment 4.1: d3.js

I created an HTML page that displays a bar chart using Studio Ghibli data written in d3.js.

### Assignment 4.2: p5.js

I created an HTML page that displays a bar chart using Studio Ghibli data written in p5.js.

### Assignment 5: Vue.js 

I created an HTML page using Vue.js that displays Studio Ghibli data and allows users to filter content using keyword search.
